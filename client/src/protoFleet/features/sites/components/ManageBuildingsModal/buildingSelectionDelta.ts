// the caller never accidentally unassigns a building the response omitted.

//
//   added: ids the operator just checked. Skipped when the item is

//
//   removed: seeded ids the operator unchecked. Skipped when the id is
//   absent from items — that means we don't actually know whether the
//   operator deselected it or whether listBuildings didn't return it. The
//   safe default is to leave it alone so the caller preserves membership.
//   Also skipped when the seeded item is now disabled: a building that was
//   reassigned to another site since the working set was seeded renders
//   ineligible, and "Select none" must not emit it as removed — doing so
//   would unassign it from that other site.
